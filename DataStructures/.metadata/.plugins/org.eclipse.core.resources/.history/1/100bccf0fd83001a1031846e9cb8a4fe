	//Collection Framework
	//List, Set, Queue All interfaces in the Collection

	//Why?
	//	Array object within Java is limited. Mainly that the array is immutable and you're not given
	//	many methods to work with.

	/*
	 * Called a framework (more library), provides interfaces and clasees that allow developers to more easily
	 * manage a group of objects.
	 * 
	 * Advantages:
	 * 		Reduces effort (provides data structure and algorithms for you)
	 * 		Increases performance
	 * 		Encourages software reuse
	 * 
	 * BUT!
	 * 		Convert primitive values into object
	 * 		ints -> Integers
	 * 		boolean -> Boolean
	 * 		byte -> Byte
	 * 
	 * 		Process of converting a primitive data types into its Wrapper class is called boxing
	 */

	/*
	 * What is a SET???
	 * 		Does not allow duplicate objects
	 * 		Does not in general guarantee insertion order
	 * 		Sets are equal if they contain the same elements
	 * 
	 * HashSet:
	 * 		Maintains no order, stores in hash table, best performance
	 * 
	 * LinkedHashSet:
	 * 		Maintains insertion order, weaker performance
	 * 
	 * TressSet:
	 * 		Maintains value order, very slow performance
