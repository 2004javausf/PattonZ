In Java, we have primitive a reference types
	Primitives - 8 types; just a value
		char- 16bits
		boolean- 1 bit
		byte- 8 bits
		short- 16 bits
		int- 32 bits
		long- 64 bits
		float-32 bits
		double- 64 bits
	**look up bit size**
	
	Reference - an object; more than just a value
	
Java is a passes by value. 
	It passes by the values of references rather than the references themselves
