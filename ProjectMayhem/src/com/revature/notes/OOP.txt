Inheritance
	When a programming language allows for a hierarchy of objects
	Child objects obtain states and behaviors from parent objects
	Multiple inheritance?? NO (kinda yes with interfaces)
	**Diamond Problem (research Homework for tonight)**
Encapsulation
	When you wrap and protect data fields, preventing manipulations outside of the class.
	Usually require getter and setter methods to change these values.
	Conceal internal state of object. Preserving integrity.
Polymorphism
	The ability for the programming language to be able to tell the difference between objects and methods or the same names with different
		variable/class types.
	Overriding - same name, same parameters, different behavior.
	Overloading - same name, different parameters, different behavior.
	Yes, many forms (incomplete definition)
	Multiple "is-a" relationships
	Object>Animal>Cat
	Animal Is-a Animal, and also an Object
	Cat Is-a Cat, Animal, and Object
	Covariance
	
Abstraction
	Sometimes omitted from pillars of OOP
	Hiding the implementation details
	"What it does, NOT how it does it"
	Exposing only functionality
	Abstract Class- abstract methods have no implementation
